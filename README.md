# _JavaScript_


_JavaScript was introduced by **Netscape** in 1995 as a lightweight scripting language to enhance web pages with interactivity, allowing code to run in the user's browser alongside **HTML** and **CSS**._

_In 1997, it was standardized as **ECMAScript** through the ECMA-262 specification, maintained by **ECMA International**. This specification established the core features of the language, ensured consistent implementation across browsers, and continues to evolve through regular updates that expand and improve the standard._

_Today, JavaScript has grown into a powerful and versatile language employed in many different environments, such as :_

* :globe_with_meridians:  _**Front-end** frameworks (React)_ 
* :gear: _**Back-end** development (Node.js)_
* :iphone: _**Mobile apps** (React Native)_
* :desktop_computer: _**Desktop apps**_
* :satellite: _**IoT** (Internet of Things)_
* :robot: _**AI**/**ML** (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning)_
* :video_game: _**Games**_

## _Overview_

_JavaScript is a **high-level**, **dynamic** programming language that is **interpreted**, meaning its code is executed line by line at runtime without the need for prior compilation. As a dynamic language, JavaScript allows variables to change types freely, and many decisions about behavior and structure are made while the program is running._

_JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including **object-oriented**, **functional** and **procedural** styles, giving developers the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits their needs. It is both dynamically and **weakly typed** (variables do not require explicit type declarations, and their types can change during execution)._

_JS code runs inside an environment called the **JavaScript engine**, which is most commonly found in web browsers (these engines read and execute the code, enabling web pages to respond to user actions in real time). Beyond browsers, JS can also run on servers, desktops and even small devices thanks to platforms like Node.js. This versatility allows developers to use the same language to build a wide range of applications._
