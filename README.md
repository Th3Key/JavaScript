# _JavaScript_


_JavaScript was introduced by **Netscape** in 1995 as a lightweight scripting language to enhance web pages with interactivity, allowing code to run in the user's browser alongside **HTML** and **CSS**.

In 1997, it was standardized as **ECMAScript** through the ECMA-262 specification, maintained by **ECMA International**. This specification established the core features of the language, ensured consistent implementation across browsers, and continues to evolve through regular updates that expand and improve the standard._

_Today, JavaScript has grown into a powerful and versatile language employed in many different environments, such as :_

* :globe_with_meridians:  _**Front-end** frameworks (React)_ 
* :gear: _**Back-end** development (Node.js)_
* :iphone: _**Mobile apps** (React Native)_
* :desktop_computer: _**Desktop apps**_
* :satellite: _**IoT** (Internet of Things)_
* :robot: _**AI**/**ML** (Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning)_
* :video_game: _**Games**_
